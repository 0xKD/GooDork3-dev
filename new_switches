Some new switches are available in this version of GooDork.
While developing implementation for them I needed to have a list
of all the switches I wanted to make available.So I thought I might kill 2
birds with one stone and keep the list here for documentation
purposes. Enjoy ;) ---k3170

Short switches:
---------------
	REGEX
		-u search for a term in the url of the page
		-t search displayable text in the title tag
		-b search displayable text
		-a search the href value of the anchor tags on the page
		-s search the contents of the script tags
		-i search the attributes of the input tags for a given value

	CONFIG
		-L limit the amount of the results processed to the first L---inclusive---
		-U use a custom user agent value

Long switches:
--------------
*please not all these options require an input file, see the --in switch

	BULK MODES
		--site run the site directive on all the url's supplied from an input file
		--related run the 'related' directive 
		--link this has nothing to do with dota i swear lols, run the 'link' directive on all URLs supplied via a file
		--anchor run the 'related' directive on all URLS supplied by an input file
	
	INFORMATION GATHERING MODES
		--passive this tells gooDork to strictly use google's cached version of the pages for searching
				*by this i mean if you ask goodork to search for things in the source of a page via -u,-t,-b etc. 
					it will make sure to request the source from cache, so that you don't make any noise in 
					the related servers' logs ;)

		--active this tells gooDork to make request to the URLs retrieved from a search
				*by this i mean if you ask goodork to search for things in the source of a page via -u,-t,-b etc.
					it will make sure to request the source straight from the related server
	INPUT-OUTPUT
		--in an input file, used to supply URLs for running goodork in any of the bulk modes
		--out the path to an output file where gooDork will neatly format all the results it retrieves
		--format the format to be used with the outfile
			these formats include
				*xml
				*csv
				*html
				*JSON
				any other formats you'd like? let me know ;) @k3170makan ---twitter
